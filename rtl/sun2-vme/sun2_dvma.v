// DVMA: a Wishbone master's accesses turned into MC68010 bus cycles.
//
// Sun calls it Direct Virtual Memory Access because that is the whole point --
// the addresses an I/O channel puts out are *virtual*, and they go through the
// same MMU as the CPU's.  Architecture Manual section 7:
//
//   "DVMA allows P1-Bus masters to directly access onboard memory with a
//    virtual address.  Direct virtual memory access avoids the dual mapping
//    problems of DMA in a virtual memory environment.  DVMA translates and
//    protects all accesses within the system in an identical fashion."
//
// On the 2/50 the 82586's multiplexed address is latched into P.A01..P.A23 by
// three ALS374s (schematic sheet A07, U702/U703/U704) and the U215 PAL drives
// P.FC = 5, supervisor data.  Downstream of those pins a DVMA cycle is
// indistinguishable from a CPU cycle, which is why nothing else in this design
// needs to know DVMA exists: the segment and page maps, the protection check,
// the bus timing chain, DTACK and the bus error register are all reused.
//
// Two things this module is responsible for that the schematic spreads across
// several parts:
//
//   * arbitration (the U214 PAL on sheet A02).  The 2/50 does *two-wire*
//     arbitration -- BGACK is tied high -- so a master holds BR asserted for as
//     long as it wants the bus and releases by negating it.  See MC68000UM
//     section 5.2: "Bus arbitration on all microprocessors ... BGACK must be
//     pulled high for 2-wire bus arbitration."  The real PAL arbitrates three
//     requesters (DRAM refresh, Ethernet, VME) in that priority order; there is
//     only one here, so what is left is the handshake.
//
//   * the byte lane crossing.  The data bus between the 82586 and the rest of
//     the machine is wired byte-reversed (ALS244 U707/U708, sheet A07;
//     Architecture Manual section 6.13, "connected to the system in a permanent
//     byte-reversed mode").  See the note on byte order below -- it is the
//     single easiest thing to get wrong here, and it fails silently.

   // Byte order
   // ----------
   // The boot PROM's driver already byte-swaps every scalar in software
   // (to_ieaddr, to_ieoff, and byte-swapped IECMD_* constants), so what is in
   // memory is Intel little-endian *at matching byte addresses*.  All the
   // hardware has to guarantee is:
   //
   //     the 82586's byte address N reaches the same memory byte the 68010
   //     calls byte address N.
   //
   // A 68010 puts the even byte of a word on D[15:8] (UDS); an Intel part puts
   // it on D[7:0].  Crossing the lanes is what makes those agree -- it cancels
   // the addressing mismatch rather than adding a second swap on top of the
   // software one.  So:
   //
   //   Wishbone byte     68010
   //   sel[0] dat[7:0]   byte addr +0, even -> UDS -> D[15:8]
   //   sel[1] dat[15:8]  byte addr +1, odd  -> LDS -> D[7:0]
   //   sel[2] dat[23:16] byte addr +2, even -> UDS -> D[15:8]
   //   sel[3] dat[31:24] byte addr +3, odd  -> LDS -> D[7:0]
   //
   // which splits one 32-bit Wishbone access into at most two 68010 word
   // cycles: the low half at {wb_adr_i, 1'b0} carrying sel[1:0], the high half
   // at {wb_adr_i, 1'b1} carrying sel[3:2].  A half with no selected byte is
   // skipped, so every SEL pattern the MAC produces -- including the awkward
   // 4'b0110 tail of an unaligned frame -- comes out as ordinary 68k cycles.
   //
   // Get this backwards and it does not look like a byte order bug: the chip
   // reads SYSBUS from 0xFFFFF7 instead of 0xFFFFF6, decides the host bus is
   // 8 bits wide, and never clears the ISCP busy flag.  It looks like a chip
   // that is not there.

   // like a chip reading plausible rubbish rather than like a timing bug.
   // **AS is released on a falling edge, and is never narrower than 2.5 clocks.**

   // The state machine runs on posedges, so driving AS straight from it puts
